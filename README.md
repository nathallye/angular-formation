## Angular Formation

- Installing Angular:

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

- Checking installed version:

```
ng version

// or 

npm start
```

- We use the ng new command to create a new project in Angular. When executing this command, a new folder will be created containing a directory structure with the necessary files to start a project in this framework:

```
ng new [project-name]
```

- Run the application:

```
ng serve
```

# Angular Formation

## Installation

- Installing Angular:

```
$ npm i -g @angular/cli
```

- Checking installed version:

```
$ ng version
```

## FIRST PROJECT: HELLO WORLD!

- We use the `ng new` command to create a new project in Angular. When executing this command, a new folder will be created containing a directory structure with the necessary files to start a project in this framework:

```
$ ng new hello-world
         [project-name]
```

- Run the application:

```
$ cd hello-world && ng serve

// or 

$ cd hello-world && npm start
```
